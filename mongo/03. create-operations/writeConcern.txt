{writeConcern : { w: <value>, j: <boolean>, wtimeout: <number> }}


w : 0 => Requests no acknowledgment of the write operation
we will get back acknowledged false ; if we find everything, we will see the document is inserted;
the server hasn't registered this document, we just sent the request and we immediately return
we don't wait for a response of this request

So the storage engine had no chance to store it in memory and generate the objectId, we get back acknowledged false
THIS IS SUPER FAST, we don't have to wait for any response

w : 1 => Requests acknowledgment 
Default

j : true => fast, because everything is run locally 

wtimeout : 200
wtimeout : 1 // fast
wtimeout : n
